                        <p>Dimbayaa Arts is a community arts initiative with a mission of <span>educating, processing, and producing traditional African and African Diaspora participation and investment.</span> African dance is an art form that many marginalized or otherwise disenfranchised populations have instinctively and even consciously tapped into for its both physical and psychological healing therapies. As such, through <span>classes, workshops, performance lectures, social activism, and cultural services</span>, such as involvement in major life events: births, deaths, various celebrations, Dimbayaa focuses on <span>creatively, facilitating opportunities for healing, restorative processes and self-expression socially, economically and politically</span>.</p> <p>Dimbayaa is a Mandeng word meaning family, our logo, the Ashanti adinkra symbol <em>Nkonsonkonson</em>, represents the links that unite us and remind us to give of ourselves and look to eachother for in unity lies strength. Thus, we aspire to catalyze <span>interdependency, resilience, and mobility</span> of all people, underscoring the African Diaspora, to further collective action and wellbeing.</p> 
                        <p>We embrace and celebrate the <span>interconnectedness of our shared human experiences</span> and seek to create a space for <span>collective identity, modes of expression and sense of personal freedom</span>. We accomplish this through collaborations with various visual performing artist and art companies. Dimbayaa is is designed to encourage individual progress through dance and drum expression, and cultural education while providing sound technical training to the community at large and African diasporic communities in particular.</p>

                        <h5>January Johnson-Ansa</h5>
                        <p>A true &quot;around-the-way&quot; girl, an all out artist, a down-to-earth mamma, and a serious pixel-pushing GEEK you can find January any day homeschooling her boys, crocheting an afghan, designing a site while singing a tune and turning a step. A natural dancer and vocalist, by age 16 she was already a powerhouse having performed on some of the biggest stages in St. Louis, MO and with some of the greatest artist worldwide, including Mamady Keita’s Tam Tam Mandingue of Washington, D.C. and Moustapha Bangoura of Les Ballets Africains. Though she has taught and performed for innumerable students and audiences she is humble and grateful for the opportunity.</p> <p>Dimbayaa is the realization of a life long ambition of January's to create a platform and support initiative for cultural artist, to support cultural and community art with capital, and opportunities for investment. </p> <p>January’s calling is Doing! If it’s dance she’s DOING IT. If it’s a song she’s SINGING IT. If it’s family she’s LOVING IT. If it’s community she’s BUILDING IT. If it a stance, she’s MAKING IT. If it’s continued exploration of Arts, Sciences and Technology, she’s LEARNING IT. And if it just feels good to her soul, ya know she’s FEELING IT!</p>
